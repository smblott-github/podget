EXAMPLE CRON JOB

Once podget is running acceptably, its most useful if you run it from a cron job
so that the new songs are available to play or load onto a portable player and
you don't have to wait for them to download.

To edit your crontab, do:

  $ crontab \-e

Then insert one line (i for insert mode), like the following:

  15 04 * * * /usr/bin/podget \-s

This will run podget at 4:15 AM every day.

AUTOMATIC CLEANUP

You can enabled automatic cleanup with every run by configuring it in your $HOME/.podget/podgetrc file. Simply set the following options:

  # Autocleanup. 
  # 0 == disabled
  # 1 == delete any old content
  cleanup=1

  # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything 
  # older than this.
  cleanup_days=7

However, some people prefer to run cleanup as a separate cron session. To do that, set the options in .podgetrc to:

  # Autocleanup.
  # 0 == disabled
  # 1 == delete any old content
  cleanup=0

  # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
  # older than this.
  cleanup_days=7

And add a cron job to run cleanup, like one of these examples:

  # Once a week on Sunday at 04:15AM
  15 04 * * Sun /usr/bin/podget \-C

SESSION CONTROL

Podget checks for already running sessions when it starts and exits if any are found.  Each session requires its own core configuration file, so for multiple sessions simply provide a unique -c <configfile> option for each.    

EXAMPLE SERVER LIST

By default, Podget uses $HOME/.podget/serverlist for the default list of servers
to contact.  However you can configure the name with the config_serverlist
variable in your $HOME/.podget/podgetrc file.

The default format is: <url> <category> <name>

NOTES:
  1. URL Rules:
    A. Any spaces in the URL needs to be converted to %20 
  2. Category Rules:
    A.  Must be one word without spaces. 
    B.  You may use underscores and dashes.
    C.  You can insert date substitions.
        %YY%  ==  Year
        %MM%  ==  Month
        %DD%  ==  Day
  3. Name Rules:
    A.  If you are creating ASX playlists, make sure the feed name does not
        have any spaces in it.
    B.  You can leave the feed name blank, and files will be saved in the category directory.
  4. Disable the downloading of any feed by commenting it out with a #.

  Example with date substitution in the category and a blank feed name.

PER-FEED WGET OPTIONS

Additional tokens in a feed definition are taken as per-feed wget options.

   <url> <category> <name> [<wget-options>...]

For example,

   <url> <category> <name> --user=USER --password=PASSWORD

HANDLING UTF-16 FEEDS

Some servers provide their feeds in UTF-16 format rather than the more common UTF-8.

To automatically convert these files, create a secondary serverlist at:

        $HOME/.podget/serverlist.utf16 

Remember to change the name of the serverlist to match what you set it to with config_serverlist if you changed it.
