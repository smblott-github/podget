This is a fork of `podget`, a simple podcast aggregator.  The official project
web page and downloads are here:

   - http://podget.sourceforge.net/

`podget` is a simple podcast aggregator optimized for running as a scheduled
background job (i.e. cron). It features support for downloading podcasts
from RSS & XML feeds, for sorting the files into folders & categories, for
importing URLs from iTunes PCAST files & OPML lists automatic M3U & ASX
playlist creation, and automatic cleanup of old files.  It also features
automatic UTF-16 conversion for podcasts hosted on MS Windows servers.

Normally, each line of the `podget` `serverlist` configuration file contains
three tokens:

   - `url` `category` `name`

Additionally, this fork adds support for basic authentication via wget.  To use
basic authentication, simply append a user name and password to the relevant
entry in `serverlist`:

   - `url` `category` `name` `username` `password`
