What is podget?
===============

Podget is a simple podcast aggregator optimized for running as a scheduled
background job (i.e. cron). It features support for downloading podcasts
from RSS & XML feeds, for sorting the files into folders & categories, for
importing URLs from iTunes PCAST files & OPML lists automatic M3U & ASX
playlist creation, and automatic cleanup of old files.  It also features
automatic UTF-16 conversion for podcasts hosted on MS Windows servers.

What's new in this fork?
========================

Mostly just stuff which makes podget work the way I need it to...

Per-feed wget options
---------------------

Normally, each line of the podget serverlist file contains three tokens:

   url category name

This fork adds support for addition per-feed wget options.  Any subseqent
tokens on the feed line are passed directly to wget.  So, to use basic
authentication, for example, use:

   url category name --user=USER --password=PASSWORD

Earlier feed filtering
----------------------

This fork filters "already-downloaded" podcasts earlier, specifically before
determining the "most_recent" podcasts to download.  This helps with feeds for
which the newest enclosures are at the bottom.

Suffix
------

This fork adds a command-line and configuration option "--suffix <SUFFIX>"
indicating an additional suffix which is appended to the name of each
downloaded file.

Retain RRS/XML Downloads
------------------------

This fork retains the original RSS/XML download file in a file named
".podget_feed_image.xml" in the podcast directory.  This can be useful for
extracting additional information about the feed, such as the associated
imagery.
