podget (0.6.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved session files to be created and stored in /tmp by default rather than
    the old location ${HOME}/.podget.  Also created dir_session configuration
    file variable so the user can reassign as they desire.
  * Added test for ownership of session files so multiple users can use the
    same session directory and their sessions won't conflict with each other.
  * Fixed so that podget can properly handle spaces in filenames.
  * Include patch by Simon Rutishauser to enable export of the server list as an
    OPML file.

podget (0.6.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated filename format fix checks so that they do not produce an error if
    that fix is not defined in your podgetrc.
  * Created filename_formatfix9 to address issues with the Audioboo feed URL
    format.  Removes "?keyed=true&amp;source=rss" from the enclosure URL.  Tried
    to make the string matches as generic as possible so that it might work for
    other feeds.  Issue submitted on Sourceforge as bug #3609600 by Markus.
    Many thanks!

podget (0.6.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Smodcast issue reported by Stephen (stallmer) on Sourceforge in Bug ID
    3605008.  Created filename format fix that works in conjunction with
    filename_formatfix4 to resolve the issue.
  * Moved all of the filename format fixes but 1 to a new function.  This cleans
    up the main loop making it easier to understand and maintain.

podget (0.6.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to filename_formatfix to correct for feeds that place the name of
    the file to be downloaded in the parameter media_url=.  Issue reported with
    the Radio France feeds by tom-angoumoisin on March 6, 2013
  * Experimenting with order of filename format fixes.  Those with more specific
    exclusionary conditions go first.  More generic last.

podget (0.6.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to filename_formatfix to correct for trailing characters on
    enclosures for the zdf.de podcasts.  Issue submitted by Joerg Schiermeier on
    Jan 20, 2013.  Thanks.
  * Fixed to display of filenames while marking older podcasts as downloaded
    with the --recent option.  Rather than display the current filename for 
    each item, it would display the last modified filename repeatedly.  Fixed
    to display the filename of the item being marked as downloaded.
  * Refined the filename_formatfix to correct filenames downloaded from
    Vimcasts.org.  Filename modification is now simpler and easier to
    understand.

podget (0.6.9) unstable; urgency=low

    all filenames downloaded from Vimcasts.org.  Bug submitted by Andi (apoisel)

  * Update to use mktemp to create temporary file for playlist sorting.  If
    mktemp is not available, the script falls back to trying to use tempfile.
    Bug submitted by Scheini-72 on Aug 20, 2012.  Thanks.
